Credit utilization is a measurement of how much of your available credit you are currently using. 
It is specifically applied to "revolving" credit, which most commonly refers to credit cards and personal lines of credit.


In the world of personal finance,
this is one of the most important numbers you have because it typically accounts for 30% of your total credit score
(second only to your payment history).
